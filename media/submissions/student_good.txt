Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is the capability of computers and machines to perform tasks that require human-like intelligence. This includes learning from data, understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and solving complex problems. AI is applied in many fields like virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and fraud prevention. There are types such as narrow AI, which handles specific tasks, and general AI, which strives to think like a human. AI continues to advance, transforming industries and opening new opportunities in science, business, and education.
